# Mercator GUI
Admin interface component for [Mercator](https://github.com/humanmade/Mercator).

Allows you to manage aliases via the WP network admin.

## Requirements
Mercator requires WordPress 3.9 or newer for the new sunrise processes. Mercator
also requires PHP 5.3+ due to the use of namespaced code.

## Installation
Include the file `gui.php` from your `sunrise.php` in the same way you include Mercator itself.

**NOTE** include `gui.php` before `mercator.php` itself!

For example:

```php
<?php
// Default mu-plugins directory if you haven't set it
defined( 'WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR' ) or define( 'WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR', WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/mu-plugins' );

require WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR . '/mercator-gui/gui.php';
require WPMU_PLUGIN_DIR . '/mercator/mercator.php';
```

## Development
##### Translations:
1. Install npm/grunt packages: Run `npm install`
2. Update .pot file including check for text-domains: Run `grunt`

## License

Mercator builds on concepts from [WPMU Domain Mapping][], written by Donncha O'Caoimh, Ron Rennick, and contributors.

Mercator relies on WordPress core, building on core functionality added in [WP27003][]. Thanks to all involved in the overhaul, including Andrew Nacin and Jeremy Felt.
